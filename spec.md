You should not need to spend more than two hours on this task. If the time allotted, was not appropriate for you (too much or too little), tell us how you spent your time, how you would embellish things if you had more time, or just feel free to spend more time.

Download or remote grab (in your code) the JSON file of a discussion located here:
http://unicorn.wmflabs.org/techtask/discussion.json

Write Javascript code that parses that json file and displays it as a series of threaded conversations. You may ignore “subscribed”, “publictags”, and “privatetags”. The “age” value is in seconds, and marks “how long ago” the response was made. A parentid of “0” means that the response is top-level.

If you have time, add a way to reply to comments and have the replies get inserted in the page.

We’re looking for:

Embellishments- Feel free to add any as you like (or discuss some if you are short on time). Think of the optional “reply to” task as a way to get your creative juices flowing.

Open-source friendliness- MediaWiki uses jQuery and MediaWiki.UI as the base library, but feel free to use any open-source tool: javascript framework or jQuery plugin to achieve the desired out.

Consideration of language and culture agnosticism, scalability, security, etc.

Wikipedia has over 500 million unique visitors a month, is available in 270 languages, and accessed from 3rd world countries on previous-generation smartphones for free 

How does your solution live in these environments?

Polish.

Does it, in short, look cool?
